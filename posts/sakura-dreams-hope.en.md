Today I finally finished Sakura Moyu~

From June 2020, when I was hacking through the raw files, to September 2021 after giving up and pushing again, and finally now, after the 2022 localization patch was released, Sakura Moyu has accompanied me for a long time. Like the DC series, it witnessed my journey from keen interest to a rushed ending, then to renewed interest after the localization came out and a full playthrough of this work.

But if I were to describe my Moyu-playing experience, I would say the gameplay feel is good, but in real life I kept losing motivation, and ultimately chose to let go. But this localization release can be described as a catalyst, mingled with the desire to repaint the past's unfinished darkness back to white; today I completed it. In this sense, I am grateful to Moyu: erasing a little of the past debris always lifts the mood, and encountering Moyu during a period of emotional turmoil and dormancy rekindled a small dream, which is very lucky indeed.

This time, the Snowman shows noticeable improvements relative to the previous Bird Bird series, yet one can also see fantasies that have been derived from the Bird Bird concepts. For instance, a Night Realm library that serves to record the book of life; there are also many new settings, like the Night Realm shining on the reverse side of reality, and we witness the snowman's mom-obsessed XP (lol).

Looking at Moyu as a whole, a single song “Sakura, Moyu” traverses Moyu from start to finish and carries the emotions it aims to express, filled with dreams and hope, wanting to transcend time to convey to a person in the future, a lifelong love that cannot be conveyed. Gentle as cherry blossoms, yet as passionate as cherry blossoms, this song ultimately reached the distant future, becoming the key that connects the future and the past; perhaps it also became a hero in the hearts of many lonely people, perhaps there is Haru, perhaps Kanade Taiga.

In the end, the Night King is saved, and everyone enjoys a happy ending. It seems that although there was aid and rescue at the call of Kanade Taiga, what mattered more was when they were brought to the moment in life filled with hope; the hope in their hearts that finally arrived was not something given by others but something they sought themselves. Of course, the snowman still torments Kuro (the snowman's daily life, lol).

The astonishing beings in the Night Realm perhaps delivered me an even greater shock: to Chi and Nacht, who treat Nacht as their own; Nana (Himeori's mother), who sacrificed herself to bring Himeori into the world and finally pushed her away; the male lead being brought out of the cruel death shadow by Asahi-nee and Toya who gave their lives for their happiness; and with Kuro, who accompanied the male lead, and Mashiro, who projected her own wishes onto the male lead and after harming him chose to become the Night Queen Mashiro. In a moment of infinite life blossoming in an instant, their actions gave me a substantial shock, and also gave a glimmer of hope and a bit of motivation to my still-dormant inner heart, rekindling the idea that perhaps I could have a dream too, perhaps such a life could happen to me, rather than endlessly pursuing money, profit, or simply “surviving.” Perhaps people are a little impulsive; I hope this newly formed future-self's imagining can someday evoke some motivation for you to go on.

Towards the end, it feels less like discussing the Moyu story and more like my own daydreams while playing; perhaps it's also my first attempt at describing my gaming feelings? In any case, Moyu is indeed an excellent game, whether I'm a fan of F-fan or just an ordinary gal-game player. It would be wonderful if more people could like this work (so when will the FD come out, lol).

That said, I'll end by posting what I would call a divine piece, “Rinne.”w
