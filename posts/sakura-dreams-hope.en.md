I've finally finished releasing Sakura Moyu today~

From June 2020, when I was gnawing through the raw text, to September 2021 when I gave up and started over, and now with the 2022 localization patch released, the final completion of Sakura Moyu has accompanied me for a long time. Like the DC series, it witnessed my move from keen interest to a rushed ending, and after the localization came out, my interest was rekindled and I finally played through the whole work.

But if I had to describe my experience of playing Moyu, I’d say the sensation was pretty good, yet life kept interrupting and I eventually lost motivation and chose to let go.

Yet this time, the localization release can be seen as a catalyst, mixed with the idea of repainting the past unfinished darkness back to pure white, and today I’ve completed it. In this sense, I am grateful for Moyu; shedding a little of the past junk always lifts my spirits. It happened during a period of emotional turbulence and quietude, and Moyu rekindled a small dream, which feels very lucky.

This Snow Man, compared to the previous Bird Bird series, shows noticeable improvements, but you can also see many ideas that branched out from the Bird Bird concepts into new fantasies, such as “The Night Country” as a library that records a life, and there are many fresh, new settings as well, like the Night Country shimmering behind reality, and I also witnessed the Snow Man’s mother-figure XP (laugh).

Looking at Moyu as a whole, a single song, “Sakura, Moyu,” can be said to run through Moyu from start to finish, carrying the emotions it aims to convey—dreams and hope, a desire to transcend time, to express to someone in the future a love that can only ever love one person for a lifetime. As gentle as a cherry blossom, and as passionate as a cherry blossom, this song eventually travels to a distant future, becoming the key that connects the future and the past, perhaps also becoming a hero in the hearts of many lonely people; perhaps Haru, perhaps Kanade Taiga.

Ultimately the Night King is saved, and everyone greets a happy end. Although there is aid and rescue under the Kanade Taiga rally, what matters more is that when they are brought to the moment in life filled with hope, the hope in their hearts is not something given by others but something they themselves sought. Of course, the Snow Man still teases Kuro (Snow Man daily, lol).

The unbelievable beings in the Night Realm leave an even greater impact on me: to Chi and Nacht who treat him as their own; Nana (Himeori’s mother) sacrificing herself to bring Himeori into the world and finally pushing her away; Asahi-nee and Toya who gave their lives to lead the male lead away from the cruel death shadow, ultimately for their happiness; and Kuro who accompanies the male lead, projecting her own wishes onto him, and after hurting him choosing to become Mashiro, the Night Queen, to repay him. In that瞬間 of infinite life, their actions give me a substantial shock and also a glimmer of hope and motivation in my still-silent heart, rekindling the sense that perhaps having a dream might be possible for me too, and that such a life could happen to me, rather than just chasing money, gains, or mere survival. Perhaps people are inherently impulsive; I hope this newly formed self’s daydreams will someday awaken a little motivation for you to keep living as well.

Finally, it feels less like discussing a Moyu story and more like my own fantasies while playing; perhaps this is also my first attempt to describe my playing feelings. Anyway, Moyu is indeed an excellent game, both for me as an F-fan and for ordinary galge players. If more people could come to love this work, that would be wonderful (so when will the FD come out, lol).

That’s all. I’ll end by sharing what I would call a divine song, “Rinne.”
