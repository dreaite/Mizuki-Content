Today I finally finished releasing Sakura Moyu~

From June 2020, gnawing through the raw build, to September 2021 when I quit and then reapplied, and now, with the 2022 localization patch released, the final completion can be said to have accompanied me for a long time. Like the DC series, it witnessed my shift from keen interest to a hasty ending, then to renewed interest after the patch and a complete playthrough of the work.

But if I really describe my experience of playing Moyu, I’d say the gameplay feel was good, yet in the recurring realities of life I lost motivation and ultimately chose to put it down. This patch release, however, can be regarded as a catalyst, mingled with the wish to repaint the past unfinished darkness back into pure white, and today I’ve accomplished it. In this sense, I am grateful to Moyu; removing a bit of the past debris always brightens the mood, and it was also during this turbulent, quiet period that Moyu appeared, rekindling a little dream—truly fortunate.

This time the Snowman shows considerable improvements compared with the previous Bird Bird series, but you can also see many ideas derived from those earlier concepts, such as a Library in the Night Country kept to record a life, and there are many brand-new settings as well, like the Night Country that shines on the back of reality, and I also witnessed the Snowman’s mother-complex XP (lol).

Looking at Moyu as a whole, a song titled "Sakura, Moyu" can be said to run through Moyu from start to finish, carrying the emotions it aims to convey—full of dreams and hope, wanting to transcend time, to communicate to someone in the future whom one will never meet the unspoken love of a lifetime. Soft and gentle like cherry blossoms, yet ardent as blossoms in bloom, this song ultimately travels to a distant future, becoming the key that connects the future and the past. Perhaps it also becomes a hero in the hearts of many lonely people—perhaps Haru, or perhaps "奏 大雅."

In the end, the Night King is saved, and everyone greets a happy end. It seems that, although there was rescue and aid for him under the gathering of "奏 大雅," what matters more is that when they are led to a life full of hope, the hope in their hearts is not something granted by others but the result of their own seeking. Of course, the Snowman will still torment Kuro (Snowman’s daily life, lol).

The unbelievable beings in the Night Country shock me even more: to Chi and Nacht who treat Nacht as their own; Nana (Hiori’s mother) who sacrifices herself to bring Hiori into the world and then pushes her forward; Asahi-nee and Toya, who pull the male lead from the shadow of a cruel death and ultimately give their lives for their happiness; and with the male lead, Kuro who projects her own wishes onto him and, after hurting him, chooses to become Mashiro, the Queen of the Night. In an instant of infinite life, their actions give me a strong shock, and also offer a glimmer of hope and a shove of motivation to my still-silent inner heart. It reawakens a sense that a dream, perhaps, could come true, and that such a life might happen to me too—rather than merely chasing money, profit, or “survival.” Perhaps people are inherently a little impulsive; I hope this newly formed self’s musings can someday rekindle a bit of your will to keep living.

To end, it feels less like discussing Moyu’s story and more like my own flight of fancy while playing; perhaps it’s even the first time I’ve tried to describe my playing experience. Nevertheless, Moyu is indeed an excellent game, whether I’m a fan of F-chu or simply a regular galgame player. If more people could come to like this work, surely that would be wonderful (so when will the fan disk come out, lol).

With that, I’ll close by attaching what I call a divine track, "Rinne" (輪廻), as the ending.
