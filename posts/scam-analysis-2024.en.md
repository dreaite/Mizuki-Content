## Scam Details

Settlement prioritized in USDT; if you miss it, message me privately.

Notice: the price for the pitch/script increased from 3 yuan to 8 yuan
            Reply form 90 yuan  increased to 160

👍👍New price: sending the script counts as one order for 8 yuan; client form submission is 160 per order

Specific operations：

    1. WhatsApp is a mainstream foreign social app, just like WeChat; we need manual lead generation—I'll give you the designated numbers, you send our recruitment ads and do follow-ups. WhatsApp doesn't require adding as a friend; with a number you can message directly. Sending the script counts as 3 yuan per order, then publish the form for the client to fill; the client fills one form worth 90
    2. Buy an old US WS account; it must be an old account newly registered—no one should waste money. An account used normally for more than ten days won't die, so no worries about dead accounts. If you don't have an account vendor, ask customer service to push one to you
    （We mainly generate US-based WhatsApp followers; the numbers must be US-based, not from other countries）
    3. Set up the name and avatar, ask customer service for them; you must change the avatar and name, otherwise it doesn't count
    4. Strictly follow our script and the designated data; if you encounter fake orders, you can try forging them—everything will be扣
    5. The data are all scraped from local job advertisement websites; they’re all part-time followers; we just do a simple follow-up; the order success rate about 3 out of 10
    6. Add as a friend; after sending the script, the order is 3 yuan; then publish the form for the client to fill; if the client fills it, send you one 90
    7. The completion format is a single screenshot of the chat with the client; that counts as completing one order for 3 yuan; publish the form for the client to fill; if filled you get 90 per order; if not filled you only get 3; with one account the minimum daily profit is at least 800+
    8. 24-hour operation; nighttime performance is better

## Scam Summary

In fact, the whole scam is full of loopholes. I analyzed this during the project pre-check, but I was still naïve enough to think the core of the scam lay only in the site’s revenue sharing and task sharing. I didn’t expect this project to be merely a teaser; the ultimate goal was to entice me to that [website](https://gacc327.com/), perhaps the project manager is someone from the site, or perhaps just an inviter, but none of that matters. What matters is that he led me to that site, and I, guided by my desire for money, paid them, thereby closing their money-making loop: luring money-lacking, money-desiring, and money-wanting-to-get-rich-quick people to pay, funneling the money into their own accounts. They even arranged a 24-hour customer service to lure people to the most expensive project; really, I could have cried.

(Man, the more I think about it the angrier I get. If you think about it this way, they’re tougher than a pixiu, swallowing your money and not only that, making you work for them and pulling more people into this scam. In this sense they’re darker than rug-pull folks. After all, besides the pixiu scheme, at least you’d have to invest some money; if you can’t climb up you’d run away. In that sense, the on-chain environment is actually the most transparent, since on-chain there’s always a record of actions; whoever cheated you can be found. Off-chain you might even be swindled and still be counting money due to information asymmetry.)

So the whole scam’s money-making logic is to lure money-seeking people to their site, and once someone pays on the site, that money cannot be withdrawn. But because most people top up and pay directly, they don’t notice. Then they arrange for people to buy accounts, which later can’t be logged in, and they proceed in the order of account—dedicated IP—data-center IP to gradually drain money. Also, because I didn’t complete their entire deception process, I’m not sure what other enticing traps lie ahead. Of course I can hypothesize: their site’s withdrawal recommendations might still work, so they could use scammed participants on that site as downlines to recruit new users (and as I said, their cheapest product is a Telegram account, so even if you want to be their downline you’d still have to keep paying them first? Truly unscrupulous). Of course, after recruiting new users and earning money, perhaps they won’t let withdrawals directly; instead they impose a high threshold to block withdrawals, then, when withdrawals are allowed, apply a lower RMB-to-USD rate and hefty fees so that the withdrawal amount is small and losses reach 20%-50%.

(Thinking this way, this environment is even worse than the crypto space. Even if they do PVP, at least there’s a consensus not to dump the price from the start (paper hands aside). This is completely you give them money and then they manipulate you into working for them because of your sunk costs.)

Of course, what they offer may indeed be usable, but in reality this setup doesn’t cost nearly that much. There are also issues with customer service responses, such as the lure of terms like dedicated IP to separate their claimed dedicated IP from normal proxies. The problem is that the two sets, in practice, aren’t very different in use; the difference lies in the IPs they call and their routing. When I showed the customer service my “little rocket” configuration, how did they instantly tell that I wasn’t using a dedicated IP? No testing; after seeing the image I sent, they immediately concluded—that’s their first flaw. Secondly, after I switched to a new number, the way we interacted also reveals a flaw: logically, the agent handling me should be the same, and they shouldn’t treat another number as the previous client — this is their second flaw. By the way, they treated the person chatting with them as if it were me. This suggests the person being scammed recently might only be me (one for one, somewhat sad, crying). Furthermore, the customer-service account and the technical account, by various details, could be operated by the same person; when I pretended to be another user, they clearly didn’t react, and perhaps they logged out from the tech account to confirm with customer service and then switched back, so the tech account showed online for a minute or two after being offline, then went offline again. Taken together, these flaws heightened my distrust and exposed my previous sense of incongruity. Perhaps they do have a product, but given my distrust, I won’t purchase any of their products again, and some items are overpriced; there’s no need for me to be just another sheep sheared by them.

Final takeaway: the main reason people fall for such a low-level scam is my own money-desiring impulse. Even with prior project research, I chose to treat the investment as a rug pull and joined to test it, and the sunk cost then led me to invest even more. If I think about it, if there were still hooks for easy money, I would surely be influenced and keep investing. So I cannot trust myself.

The lesson this time is that as a human, I will inevitably be influenced by various desires, and if someone guides me via a certain desire, I will be affected. Therefore I should restrain myself with rationality, first considering the investment’s return, the safety of the principal after investment, and whether the investment path truly yields profits. Also, whether this project is truly viable, whether there are other investments with higher returns and less work. In short, I hope to lose less next time I get scammed. By the way, after being scammed, I can still remain this calm—perhaps this is indeed what the crypto world has taught me: to believe that even if I lose now, I can still earn back those losses later.
